# Pointer Events

This package extends [Pointer Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) to handle other browser inputs and gestures such as: tap, pan/drag, rotate, swipe and pinch/zoom. This library doesn't implement any fallback code so before using it make sure that your target browsers [support](https://caniuse.com/pointer) pointer events natively.
